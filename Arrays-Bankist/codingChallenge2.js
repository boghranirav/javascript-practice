Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
Your tasks:
Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
1. Calculatethedogageinhumanyearsusingthefollowingformula:ifthedogis <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4
2. Excludealldogsthatarelessthan18humanyearsold(whichisthesameas keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
3. Calculatetheaveragehumanageofalladultdogs(youshouldalreadyknow from other challenges how we calculate averages 😉)
4. Runthefunctionforbothtestdatasets
Test data:
§ Data1:[5,2,4,1,15,8,3] § Data2:[16,6,10,5,6,1,4]
*/
const age = [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4];

const calcAverageHumanAge = function (ages) {
  const humanAge = ages.map((age) => (age <= 2 ? 2 * age : 16 + age * 4));

  const adult = humanAge.filter((age) => age > 18);
  console.log(humanAge);
  console.log(adult);

  const avg = adult.reduce((acc, age) => acc + age, 0) / adult.length;
  console.log(avg);
};

calcAverageHumanAge(age);

const calcAverageHumanAgeArrow = (ages) =>
  ages
    .map((age) => (age <= 2 ? 2 * age : 16 + age * 4))
    .filter((age) => age > 18)
    .reduce((acc, age, i, arr) => acc + age / arr.length, 0);

console.log(calcAverageHumanAgeArrow(age));
