2. Usealooptocalculatetheaverageoddandlogittotheconsole(Wealready studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
3. Printthe3oddstotheconsole,butinaniceformattedway,exactlylikethis:
Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33 Odd of draw: 3.25
Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them (except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the same property names ðŸ˜‰
4. Bonus:Createanobjectcalled'scorers'whichcontainsthenamesofthe players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this game, it will look like this:
